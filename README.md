This workshop series held at the Max Planck Institute for the Study of Societies is designed for researchers interested in learning how to use quantitative text analysis (QTA) and natural language processing (NLP). 

The course is especially designed for beginners and does not require any previous knowledge of QTA, NLP or indeed of the Python programming environment. 

The workshop series is designed as a two-part series. The first two-day workshop is designed as an introduction to some of the core concepts and methods in text-as-data analysis (e.g. frequency analysis, sentiment
analysis, bag-of-words models) as well as an introduction to the Python programming environment. 

The second two-day workshop, which builds on what was learnt on the first, focuses instead on machine learning text classification models, the transformers-based architecture and large language models (LLMs).
